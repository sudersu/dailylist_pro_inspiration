# DailyList Pro - APK Conversion Status

## Project Overview
This is a Flutter-based task management application called "DailyList Pro" with the following features:
- Task creation, editing, and deletion
- Task completion tracking  
- Local storage using SharedPreferences
- Google Mobile Ads integration
- Local notifications (basic setup)
- Cross-platform support (Android, iOS, Web, etc.)

## Current Status
❌ **APK Build Failed** - Java 21 compatibility issue with Android build tools

## The Problem
The main blocker is a Java 21 compatibility issue with Android SDK platform-34:
```
Error while executing process /usr/lib/jvm/java-21-openjdk-amd64/bin/jlink
```

## App Features (Ready)
- ✅ Task management (create, edit, delete, complete)
- ✅ Local storage persistence
- ✅ Settings management
- ✅ Google Ads integration (configured)
- ⚠️ Notifications (basic setup, advanced features commented out)
- ✅ Modern Material Design UI
- ✅ Cross-platform compatibility

## Solution Required
Use Java 17 environment instead of Java 21:
```bash
# Install Java 17
sudo apt install openjdk-17-jdk

# Set Java 17 as default
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk-amd64

# Build APK
flutter build apk --release
```

The app is functionally complete and ready for APK conversion once the Java environment issue is resolved.
